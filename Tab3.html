        Eatogether 
      </h2>
      <pre>
        Eatogether takes real person’s phone number to register. It targets to help 
        a small circle of friends, usually less than 50,to share dining availability 
        and preference. You can tell certain portion or all your friends when you 
        are available for a meal and what do you want to eat. 
        Before, 30 mins before dinner, you call 4 friends asking whether they want 
        to eat dinner together. A and B are going. Then you are the busy middle man 
        to coordinate what time works for everyone and what restaurant to go. At end, 
        because A and B have different preference for food, you don’t know who you 
        should eat with.
        Now, 6 hours before dinner, you and your friend A and B changes status for 
        dinner on Eatogether. 3 hours before dinner, you find both A and B are free 
        at 6 tonight and would like to go to Chinese restaurant, the same as you. 
        Since you know everything now, you can just call or text them, saying 
        “Hey, 6pm today, China First. Let’s go.”
