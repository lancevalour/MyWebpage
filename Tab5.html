      <span>to support the education in Northwestern China in 2011. We provide free English lessons to local students. I have prepared to improve students their reading skills and vocabulary. I love the experience when being with students, most of them have never been out of town and don't know what the outside looks like. I tell them to work hard so they have the chance to fly over the mountain. But sending a group of volunteers every year won't help for a long time and I have the feeling that it is not human has the disadvantage when learning something, it is the technology has the disadvantage when it falls short to provide opportunities of learning. Distant learning can be a solution and later on the Siyuan Community works with IBM to provide Internet education as well as cloud platform for companies and university interested in social welfare.

  <h2>
    Running

  </h2>
  <p>
    I began running in freshman year when I was over 240 lbs. I decided to lose weight and running became my weapon against fat. I ran slowly at the beginning and below 2 miles every time and 
    grdually speeded up and ran longer. After one semester, my weight is 170 lbs(Of course I was on diet too). Running later became my habit, part of life. In sophomore I could run over 10 miles 
    as I wish so I participated in Shanghai International Half Marathon. I finished it in an hour and thirty and it was the moment I really felt proud of myself. In junior, I was in Ohio State as 
    an exchange student, I joined OSU running club and I participated Columbus Half Marathon. Nowadays I will still run if I have some spare time because I enjoy the happiness running 
    gives me, as well as the pain.
